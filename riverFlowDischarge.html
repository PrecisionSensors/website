		<h2>Flow discharge radar system</h2>

		<p>The flow discharge radar system comprises of two radars.  The first radar measures the velocity of the 
		   surface river flow and the second radar measures the vertical height of the fixed radar from the river.
		</p>
		
		<p>The river discharge or volume flow rate in m3/second is calculated from the cross-sectional area of the 
		   river together with the river surface velocity and the vertical height of the river surface from the radar.
		</p>
		
		<p>The surface velocity measuring radar works on the doppler phenomenon whereby an electromagnetic wave (EM) 
		   of 24 GHz is transmitted and reflected from the flowing river. Due to doppler effect the reflected EM is 
		   at a slightly different frequency which is proportional to the river velocity. The received EM is compared 
		   with the transmitted EM and the river surface velocity is calculated.

	    <p class="clear">The level radar works on 60 GHz and uses Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) concept. 
		   It measures the height of the radar from the water surface.

		<p class="clear">The combined radar system is able to calculate volume flow rate of the river or can be used as an early 
		   warning flood radar. During a flood, first the surface velocity of the river increases and then after a
		   period of time the water level in the river starts to rise. By having access to both the surface velocity 
		   and surface level (vertical height) data, an early flood warning system can be devised.
